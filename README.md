JavaDataStructureExamples
=========================

A few examples of my implementations of classic algorithms and data structures.

GraphSearch - Breadth-first search, depth-first search, and Dijkstra's SPF algorithm. (Interfaces and structures provided by my course.)

Sorting - Bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort, mergesort, radix sort. (Interface provided by my course.)

StringSearch - Boyer-Moore and Rabin-Karp string search (Interface provided by my course.)

Tree - BST and AVL trees. (Interfaces and structures provided by my course.)
